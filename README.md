This is an app created to discover React.

I'm following the Complete developer course 2022 from ZTM.

It's a list of "Robots" That gets refreshed everytime we type something in the search bar by searching the Robots by their names.

Still a WIP.


TODO :

- Missing Background
- Title style
- Will probably update the name with cats, since these are not robots but cats :)
